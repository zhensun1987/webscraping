# webscraping

Sample code to use Python's BeautifulSoup and lxml packages to crawl information on webpages

The webpage I crawl is www.google.com/patents/, the information I'd like to get is names of patent inventors, assignees, the publication date and finally the filing date of the patent.

You will be asked to choose one of the method and input the patent publication number; the crawled information will be saved as a .csv file.
